# Python Adventure Game 
This is an interactive adventure game. You (the user) control the input and therefore the results. 

# Description
You are in a town were everyone is sad and gloomy. Your task is to use one of the three keys in your bag to help unlock happiness for those you encounter. 

If you give them the key to happiness, their hearts either turn red or they become less gloomy. 

If you give them the wrong key, their sadness persists or they may even become gloomier. 

When you have turned enough hearts red, you win the game. 

# Requirements

This is a project I made for school and will extend in the near future.
